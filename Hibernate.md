# ðŸ“˜ Hibernate: What It Is and What It's Used For

**Hibernate** is an **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** framework for Java. It allows developers to **map Java objects (POJOs) to relational database tables**, and vice versa, making database interaction **simpler, cleaner, and more maintainable**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is Hibernate?

Hibernate is a **Java-based ORM tool** that:
- Simplifies database access in Java applications.
- Automatically handles the mapping between **Java classes** and **database tables**.
- Reduces the need for writing complex **JDBC code**, SQL queries, and result set processing.
- Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java that allows developers to map Java objects to database tables. It abstracts away JDBC boilerplate code and manages data persistence efficiently.

## Advantages of Hibernate over JDBC?

- No need to write SQL manually for CRUD operations.
- Automatic table creation via annotations or XML.
- Caching improves performance.
- Provides HQL (Hibernate Query Language) â€“ object-oriented and database-independent.
- Handles complex relationships and lazy loading.

---

## What is ORM?
Answer:
ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is a technique that maps Java objects to relational database tables. Hibernate is an implementation of ORM that provides automatic table-to-class and column-to-field mapping.

## ðŸ”¹ Hibernate Architecture Overview

- **Configuration**: Reads settings (from `hibernate.cfg.xml` or annotations).
- **SessionFactory**: Creates `Session` objects and is a heavyweight object (one per database).
- **Session**: Provides methods to interact with the database.
- **Transaction**: Manages atomic database operations.
- **Query**: Supports HQL and native SQL queries.

---

## What are the core interfaces of Hibernate?
SessionFactory: Itâ€™s a factory for Session objects and is thread-safe. It holds the configuration details and caches data that is reusable across sessions.
Session: Represents a connection to the database, managing CRUD operations, and is not thread-safe.
Transaction: Manages atomic operations â€” ensuring either all DB operations succeed or none.
Query: Enables you to perform queries using HQL or native SQL.
Configuration: Used at startup to configure Hibernate and create the SessionFactory

---

## How to configure Hibernate in a Java application?
Answer:
Hibernate can be configured using:
hibernate.cfg.xml: XML configuration file.
Configuration class to build SessionFactory.
Or in Spring Boot, itâ€™s configured via application.properties:

properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=pass

---

## What is hibernate.cfg.xml?
Answer:
- The hibernate.cfg.xml file is the primary configuration file where you specify how Hibernate should connect to the database and behave. It contains properties such as:
- Database dialect (e.g., MySQLDialect, OracleDialect).
- JDBC connection details like driver class, URL, username, and password.
- Session management properties.
- Caching and transaction management settings.
- Mapping resource declarations.

An XML file used to define database connection settings, entity class mappings, and other Hibernate properties. Example:
<hibernate-configuration>
  <session-factory>
    <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>
    <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver</property>
    ...
  </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>

## How do you map a one-to-many relationship in Hibernate using annotations?
In a one-to-many mapping, the parent entity holds a collection of child entities. You annotate the collection in the parent with @OneToMany and specify the mappedBy attribute indicating the field that owns the relationship in the child. The child entity has a @ManyToOne annotation with a @JoinColumn indicating the foreign key.

For example, a Department entity has many Employee entities:
@Entity
public class Department {
   @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
   private List<Employee> employees;
}

@Entity
public class Employee {
   @ManyToOne
   @JoinColumn(name = "dept_id")
   private Department department;
}

## Difference between LAZY and EAGER fetching?
Answer:
LAZY fetch type means related data is loaded only when it is accessed, which is more efficient for large or complex associations because it avoids unnecessary data retrieval. EAGER fetch loads the related entities immediately along with the parent entity, which can simplify access but may degrade performance if the associated data is large or not always needed.
LAZY: Data is loaded on-demand (better performance).
EAGER: Data is loaded immediately (can cause unnecessary joins).

@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List<Employee> employees;

---

## What is @JoinColumn and @JoinTable?
Answer:
@JoinColumn is used to specify the foreign key column in the owning side of an association (typically many-to-one or one-to-one). It tells Hibernate which column holds the foreign key.

@JoinTable is used primarily for many-to-many relationships to define an intermediate join table with foreign keys pointing to both associated entities.

---

## How is inheritance mapped in Hibernate?
Answer:
Hibernate supports several inheritance strategies:
SINGLE_TABLE: All classes in the hierarchy are stored in one table with a discriminator column.
JOINED: Each class has its own table, and joins are performed to retrieve the full object.
TABLE_PER_CLASS: Each class has its own table with all fields, duplicating parent class fields.
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)

---

## What is HQL and how is it different from SQL?
Answer:
HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is object-oriented.
Operates on entity class names and fields, not table names and columns.

Query q = session.createQuery("FROM Employee WHERE salary > :min");
q.setParameter("min", 50000);

---

 ## What is the difference between get() and load()?
Method	Behavior
get()	Returns null if object not found; hits DB immediately.
load()	Throws ObjectNotFoundException; uses proxy and loads lazily.

---

## What is cascading in Hibernate?
Answer:
- Cascading controls how operations performed on one entity propagate to its associated entities. For example, if you save or delete a parent object, cascading determines whether those operations should also be applied to the child objects automatically, reducing the need for manual handling of each associated entity.
- Cascade types (e.g., CascadeType.ALL, PERSIST, REMOVE) define how operations propagate from parent to child entities.

@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private List<Employee> employees;

---

## What are first-level and second-level caches in Hibernate?
- The first-level cache is session-scoped, mandatory, and caches objects within a single Hibernate session, preventing multiple database hits for the same object during a session.
- The second-level cache is optional and session-factory scoped. It caches objects across sessions and can be configured to use providers like EHCache or Infinispan to improve performance on repeated data access.

---

## How do you configure Hibernate to use second-level cache?
Add a caching provider like EHCache, configure cache regions in hibernate.cfg.xml or properties, and annotate entities with @Cache specifying cache strategy (READ_WRITE, NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE, etc.).

---

## How do you handle transactions in Hibernate?
Transactions ensure data integrity by grouping multiple operations into a single unit of work. In Hibernate, you start a transaction using session.beginTransaction(), perform your operations, and then commit or rollback based on success or failure. In Spring-managed applications, you typically use the @Transactional annotation to handle transaction demarcation declaratively.

---

## What is the difference between save(), persist(), update(), merge(), and saveOrUpdate() methods?
- save(): Inserts a new record, returns generated identifier.
- persist(): Like save(), but follows JPA standards, no return value.
- update(): Updates an existing detached entity.
- merge(): Copies state of a detached entity onto a persistent entity and returns it.
- saveOrUpdate(): Either saves a new entity or updates an existing one based on its state.

---

## Explain the Hibernate session lifecycle and states of an entity.
- Entities can be in 3 states:
Transient: Object not associated with Hibernate session, not persisted.
Persistent: Object is associated with session and changes will be saved.
Detached: Object was persistent but session is closed or object is evicted.

---

## What is the difference between flush() and commit() in Hibernate?
- flush(): Synchronizes Hibernate session state with the database but doesnâ€™t end the transaction.

- commit(): Flushes session and commits the transaction to make changes permanent.

---

## What are some common performance optimization techniques in Hibernate?
- Use lazy loading wisely to avoid unnecessary fetching.
- Enable second-level and query cache.
- Use batch processing for bulk operations.
- Avoid n+1 select problem by using JOIN FETCH or entity graphs.
- Use projections to select only required columns.

---

## What is the n+1 select problem? How do you avoid it?
This occurs when Hibernate executes one query for the main entity and then executes additional queries for each associated entity (n queries). It causes performance issues. Avoid it by using eager fetching via JOIN FETCH, batch fetching, or query optimization techniques.

---

## How do you implement pagination in Hibernate?
Using setFirstResult() and setMaxResults() methods on Query or Criteria to fetch a subset of results, useful for handling large datasets in pages.

---

## What is the difference between Criteria API and HQL?
HQL is string-based, object-oriented query language.

Criteria API is programmatic, typesafe, and easier to build dynamic queries.

---

## How do you handle optimistic locking in Hibernate?
Use @Version annotation on a version field. Hibernate checks the version before updating, preventing lost updates in concurrent transactions.

---

## How do you manage Hibernate exceptions?
Hibernate throws unchecked exceptions (subclasses of HibernateException). You typically catch these to handle database errors gracefully, or use Springâ€™s @Transactional with rollback on exceptions.

---

## Explain Hibernate Validator and how it works.
Hibernate Validator is the reference implementation of Bean Validation API (JSR-380). It allows defining validation rules on entity fields using annotations (e.g., @NotNull, @Size), automatically validated before persisting or updating.

---
