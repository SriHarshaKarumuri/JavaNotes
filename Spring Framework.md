## üîπ Introduction to Spring Framework

The **Spring Framework** is a powerful framework used to develop Java-based enterprise applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. The key components of the Spring Framework are:

1. **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Dependency Injection (DI) helps in decoupling components.
2. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Separation of concerns, like logging and transaction management.
3. **Spring MVC**: Web framework for building web applications.
4. **Spring Security**: Authentication and Authorization framework.
5. **Spring Boot**: Simplifies Spring application development with embedded servers and default configurations.

## üîπ Spring AOP

### AOP Concepts

- **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** is a programming paradigm that separates cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) from the main business logic.
- Key Concepts:
  - **Aspect**: A module that contains cross-cutting concerns.
  - **Join Point**: A point in the execution of the program (e.g., method execution).
  - **Advice**: The action to be taken at a specific join point.
  - **Pointcut**: A predicate that matches join points.
  - **Weaving**: The process of applying aspects to the target code.

### Annotations for AOP

1. **@Aspect**: Used to define an aspect.
2. **@Before**: Executes before a method execution.
3. **@After**: Executes after a method execution.
4. **@AfterReturning**: Executes after a method execution if it completes successfully.
5. **@AfterThrowing**: Executes after a method execution if it throws an exception.
6. **@Around**: Wraps method execution, and can modify arguments, return values, or exceptions.

### AOP Configuration

#### XML-based Configuration:
```xml
<bean id="loggingAspect" class="com.example.LoggingAspect" />
<aop:config>
    <aop:aspect ref="loggingAspect">
        <aop:before method="logBefore" pointcut="execution(* com.example.*.*(..))" />
    </aop:aspect>
</aop:config>

What is Spring Boot? 
Spring Boot is a set of preconfigured modules that works on top of Spring Framework and 
simplifies configuring a Spring application.
Some of the more central modules are:
- Spring-boot-dependencies. Contains versions of dependencies
- Spring-boot-starter-parent. Parent pom.xml
- Spring-boot-starters. Parent for all the Spring-Boot starter modules
- Spring-boot-autoconfigure. Contains the autoconfigure modules for the starters.
- Spring-boot-actuator. Allows for monitoring and managing of application created
What are the advantages of using Spring Boot? 
- Automatic configuration of ‚Äúsensible defaults‚Äù reducing boilerplate configuration
- Allows for easy customization when the defaults no longer suffices
- A Spring Boot project can produce an executable stand-alone JAR-file
- Provides a set of managed dependencies that have been verified to work together
- Integrated web containers that allow for easy testing
Why is it ‚Äúopinionated‚Äù? 
It makes assumptions on what you need based on dependencies from the classpath. Convention 
over configuration - pre-configures Spring app by reasonable defaults, which can be 
overridden.
How does it work? How does it know what to configure? 
Spring Boot detects the dependencies available on the classpath and configures Spring beans
accordingly. There are a number of annotations, examples are @ConditionalOnClass, 
@ConditionalOnBean, @ConditionalOnMissingBean and @ConditionalOnMissingClass, 
that allows for applying conditions to Spring configuration classes or Spring bean declaration 
methods in such classes. Examples:
- A Spring bean is to be created only if a certain dependency is available on the classpath. 
Use @ConditionalOnClass and supply a class contained in the dependency in question.
- A Spring bean is to be created only if there is no bean of a certain type or with a certain 
name created. Use @ConditionalOnMissingBean and specify name or type of bean to 
check.
What things affect what Spring Boot sets up? 
There are a number of condition annotations in Spring Boot each of which can be used to 
control the creation of Spring beans. The following is a list of the condition annotations in 
Spring Boot (there are more):
Condition Annotation Condition Factor
@ConditionalOnClass Presence of class on classpath
@ConditionalOnMissingClass Absence of class on classpath
@ConditionalOnBean Presence of Spring bean or bean type (class)
@ConditionalOnMissingBean Absence of Spring bean or bean type (class)
@ConditionalOnProperty Presence of Spring environment property
@ConditionalOnResource Presence of resource such as file
@ConditionalOnWebApplication If the application is considered to be a web 
application, that is uses the Spring 
WebApplicationContext
@ConditionalOnNotWebApplication If the application is not considered to be a 
web application
How are properties defined? Where is Spring Boot‚Äôs default property 
source? 
Spring Boot uses a very particular PropertySource order that is designed to allow sensible 
overriding of values. Properties are considered in the following order:
1. Devtools global settings properties on your home directory (~/.spring-boot 
devtools.properties when devtools is active).
2. @TestPropertySource annotations on your tests.
3. @SpringBootTest#properties annotation attribute on your tests.
4. Command line arguments.
5. Properties from SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON (inline JSON embedded in an 
environment variable or system property).
6. ServletConfig init parameters.
7. ServletContext init parameters.
8. JNDI attributes from java:comp/env.
9. Java System properties (System.getProperties()).
10. OS environment variables.
11. A RandomValuePropertySource that has properties only in random.*.
12. Profile-specific application properties outside of your packaged jar (application-
{profile}.properties and YAML variants).
13. Profile-specific application properties packaged inside your jar (application-
{profile}.properties and YAML variants).
14. Application properties outside of your packaged jar (application.properties and YAML 
variants).
15. Application properties packaged inside your jar (application.properties and YAML 
variants).
16. @PropertySource annotations on your @Configuration classes.
17. Default properties (specified by setting SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties).
Also, I‚Äôve found that if you have both application.properties and application.yml side by side 
at the same level of precedence, properties in application.yml will override those in 
application.properties.
Would you recognize common Spring Boot annotations and 
configuration properties if you saw them in the exam? 
@SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those three features, that is:
- @EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Boot‚Äôs auto-configuration mechanism
- @ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application 
is located (see the best practices)
- @Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional 
configuration classes
Other common Spring Boot Annotations:
- @EnableConfigurationProperties. Enables support for Spring beans annotated with 
@ConfigurationProperties
- @ConfigurationProperties. Allows for binding a selected group of configuration 
properties to a class
- @WebMvcTest. Annotation used in Spring MVC tests testing only Spring MVC 
components.
- @SpringBootTest
- @DataJpaTest
What is the difference between an embedded container and a WAR? 
Embedded container is a server that comes with the resulting application whereas WAR is an 
archive that can be deployed on an external container.
Servlet containers are great to manage multiple applications on a single host but don't seem 
very useful to manage just one single application. With cloud environments, a single 
application per virtual machine seems preferable and more common. Modern frameworks want 
to be cloud compatible, therefore the shift to embedded servers.
What embedded containers does Spring Boot support? 
Spring Boot includes support for embedded Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow servers.
What does @EnableAutoConfiguration do? 
The @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation enables Spring Boot auto-configuration. As 
earlier, Spring Boot autoconfiguration attempts to create and configure Spring beans based on 
the dependencies available on the class-path to allow developers to quickly get started with 
different technologies in a Spring Boot application and reducing boilerplate code and 
configuration.
What about @SpringBootApplication? 
@SpringBootApplication does 3 things:
- turns on autoconfig (@EnableAutoConfiguration)
- enables auto-scanning (@ComponentScan)
- defines a configuration class (@Configuration)
Does Spring Boot do component scanning? Where does it look by 
default? 
If it‚Äôs annotated with @SpringBootApplication. The @SpringBootApplication annotation is 
often placed on your main class, and it implicitly defines a base ‚Äúsearch package‚Äù for certain 
items.
What is a Spring Boot starter POM? Why is it useful? 
Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in 
your application. You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technology that you 
need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads of dependency 
descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and JPA for database access 
just include the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency in your project, and you are good to 
go.
The starters contain a lot of the dependencies that you need to get a project up and running 
quickly and with a consistent, supported set of managed transitive dependencies.
Spring Boot supports both Java properties and YML files. Would you 
recognize and understand them if you saw them? 
Java properties files come in application.properties file; YAML come in application.yml.
YML:
Properties:
Can you control logging with Spring Boot? How? 
Controlling Log Levels 
As per default, messages written with the ERROR, WARN and INFO levels will be output in 
a Spring Boot application. To enable DEBUG or TRACE logging for the entire application, 
use the --debug or --trace flags or set the properties debug=true or trace=true in the 
application.properties file.
Log levels can be controlled at a finer granularity using the application.properties file:
File Output 
By default, Spring Boot logs only to the console and does not write log files. If you want to 
write log files in addition to the console output, you need to set a logging.file or logging.path 
property (for example, in your application.properties).
Color-coding of Log Levels 
In consoles that support ANSI, messages of different log levels can be color-coded to improve 
readability. This can be accomplished as shown in the following example:
Suppose that you want to write the log entries to a file named BookWorm.log at /var/logs/. 
The logging.path and logging.file properties can help with that:
