---

## -_- . Explain about your roles and responsibilities.
In my current role as an Associate Engineer at Virtusa, I am involved in both development and maintenance activities.
I was responsible for understanding requirements given by the client, writing backend logic in Java using Spring Boot, and writing some SQL queries for database operations,developing of RESTful APIs under senior developers hood also contributed in ensuring code quality,fixing bugs and maintaining code coverages using tools like Jacoco and SonarQube. Tools like Swagger are used for API documentation and attending scrum calls daily and following scrum architecture.

## Can you describe the project you worked on at Health First and your role in it?
I have worked on health care domain where the client is Health First and project name is Patient Data Management where receiptionist can track all the data of the patients and their diagnostics reports and can schedule appointments to the particular doctors where Receiptionist role has CRUD operation priviliges so here as in a team i used to developing of RESTful APIs under senior developers which are used used to get data and  communicate b/w different services in the microservices architecture which helps in maintaing the dashbboards and also i used to maintain code quality,fixing bugs and maintaining code coverages using tools like Jacoco and SonarQube.

## Tell me about a challenge you faced in your project and how you resolved it.
1. While working with code quality and code coverages i used to miss some areas to scan where it doesnt give me the reqiuired quality.
2. some times sql queries return some inconsistent data due to wrong usage of joins.
3. when working with microservices architecture used to missconfigure some ports and properties where the communication b/w the services got effected and it tooks me a lot of time to debug myself.
4. Once while trying to understand the code logic a part of code is developed using  mulithreading and concurrency which is like advanced level where i have only theortical basic knowledge regarding that there i felt a bit hard to understand partially.
5. In these all areas when i got problems i used to ask my seniors to help me in debugging and how to resolve these issues.


## How do you handle situations where you’re asked to do something you haven't done before?
Once my manager asked me to write the unit tests and performance tests for the code where i have very less knowledge in both testings and tried to start writing the unit test cases where i have not covered some critical cases and also wrote some test cases incorrectly so then i tried to learn about more on unit testing and performance testing.i treat it like a learning chance so then i learnt some on unit testing.

## How did your team handle production issues or urgent client requirements?
 1. we follow agile methodology here first we log the issue in our jira tool as a production bug then we will prioritize it based on severity like critical outage then a swat team is formed Developer QA and Ops team to debug then a post-mortem call is placed Root Cause analysis What,Why,How it happedned and how to fix and how to preven it, and retrospective discussion happens and implement some automated tasks or monitoring alerts to fix those.

 2. If urgent client requirement means high priority from the client be addressed immediately or within a very short timeframe first we inform scrum master regarding this If it's critical, the team may pause current sprint tasks to address it. and log it as a ** Spike or Urgent Story ** Inform the client of the expected timeline.Update internal stakeholders on sprint impact
 

## You have theoretical knowledge, but how will you bridge the gap between theory and real-world experience?
I’m already doing that by building small practice projects, reading architecture case studies, videos on microservices and CI/CD to understand what can go wrong in production, observing my team mates on their work in writing the code for the use cases.

## Imagine a scenario where a senior developer disagrees with your approach. How would you handle that?
Firstly i will try to convey my approach to the senior developer by showing
